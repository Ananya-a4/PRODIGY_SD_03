This repository contains a Java-based console application for managing contacts. Users can add, view, edit, and delete contacts using a simple menu-driven interface.

## Description

The Contact Management System lets users store contact information, including name, phone number, and email address. The program runs in a loop, displaying options for managing contacts until the user chooses to exit.

## Features

Add Contact: Enter a name, phone number, and email address to create a new contact.

View Contacts: Display all saved contacts with their details.

Edit Contact: Update the details of an existing contact by providing its index.

Delete Contact: Remove a contact by specifying its index.

Exit: Terminate the program.

## How It Works

Menu Display: The program continuously shows a menu with options.

User Input: Users select an option by entering a number (1â€“5).

Contact Operations: Based on the chosen option, the program performs the corresponding action.

Looping Logic: The menu reappears until the user chooses to exit.
